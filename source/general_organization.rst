General organization of the documentation
=========================================

A word on the documentation
---------------------------

This documentation is divided in several complementary parts. It is a constant work in progress, so do not hesitate to contact us if you spot any inaccuracy, examples that are not working anymore, or simply parts that need clarification. The easiest way to signal a problem in the documentation is to create an issue on `github`_

Organization of the documentation
---------------------------------

As said above, the documentation is segmented into different parts: 

* :doc:`user_guide`: The user guide is there to give you information as an end-user of the code. It is the guide you will use if you want to compile and run Dyablo simulations without having to modify the code.
* :doc:`developer_guide`: The developer guide is there to guide you on writing your first plugins, contribute on gitlab/github and on generally modifying the code.
* :doc:`lexicon`: A lot of terms can be sometimes taken for granted. To make sure we are all on the same page, most technical terms are defined in the lexicon. If a term is unclear, or that you are not sure of its meaning, please refer to this page.
* :doc:`community`: This page references the community efforts of Dyablo: how to interact with us, who is working on the code, what acknowledgements you should use when publishing with Dyablo, etc.
* :doc:`publication_list`: A list of publications and talks done on Dyablo or using Dyablo.* 
* :doc:`reference`: The reference is there to document the actual classes of Dyablo. It is mostly meant for developers that want to have a quick look at the code documentation.
